# Warhammer 40,000: Space Wolf

{% include 'includes/video_game.html' %}

Space Wolf is a decent mobile port with garbage economy clearly built around
microtransactions. Building a strong deck requires an awful lot of grinding.
The game has levels designed specifically for grinding.

The combat in Space Wolf is a lot like the original Fallout, the difference
being how action points work. In Fallout, you generate APs first, then spend
them; in Space Wolf, you do things costing you action points, and then wait
until they regenerate. Play cheaper actions, and you get to take more turns.

There is no real story, but the missions are genuinely fun to play. The
default difficulty feels fair and challenging (until you build a deck of
legendary cards, and proceed to faceroll anything the game throws at you.)

In conclusion, Space Wolf is not offensively bad.
