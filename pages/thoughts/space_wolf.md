# Warhammer 40,000: Space Wolf

The combat in Space Wolf is a lot like the original Fallout, the difference
being how action points work. In Fallout, you generate APs first, then spend
them; in Space Wolf, you do things costing you action points, and then wait
until they regenerate. Play cheaper actions, and you get to take more turns.
